# Comment or remove the line below.
#Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
LogFile /var/log/clamav/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please
# copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with --config-file option).
# This option disables log file locking.
# Default: no
#LogFileUnlock yes

# Maximum size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
# Default: 1M
LogFileMaxSize 0

# Log time with each message.
# Default: no
LogTime yes

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.
# Default: no

# Path to a local socket file the daemon will listen on.
# Default: disabled (must be specified by a user)
LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows
# ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite. If you turn off this option, the original files will still be
# scanned, but without additional processing.
# Default: yes
ScanPE yes

# Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X executables.
# This option allows you to control the scanning of ELF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without additional processing.
# Default: yes
ScanELF yes

# With this option clamav will try to detect broken executables (both PE and
# ELF) and mark them as Broken.Executable.
# Default: no
DetectBrokenExecutables yes


##
## Documents
##

# This option enables scanning of OLE2 files, such as Microsoft Office
# documents and .msi files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without additional processing.
# Default: yes
ScanOLE2 yes


# With this option enabled OLE2 files with VBA macros, which were not
# detected by signatures will be marked as "Heuristics.OLE2.ContainsMacros".
# Default: no
#OLE2BlockMacros no

# This option enables scanning within PDF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without decoding and additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanPDF yes


##
## Mail files
##

# Enable internal e-mail scanner.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without parsing individual messages/attachments.
# Default: yes
ScanMail yes

# Scan RFC1341 messages split over many emails.
# You will need to periodically clean up $TemporaryDirectory/clamav-partial directory.
# WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack.
#	   Never use it on loaded servers.
# Default: no
#ScanPartialMessages yes


# With this option enabled ClamAV will try to detect phishing attempts by using
# signatures.
# Default: yes
#PhishingSignatures yes

# Scan URLs found in mails for phishing attempts using heuristics.
# Default: yes
#PhishingScanURLs yes

# Always block SSL mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in the database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch no

# Always block cloaked URLs, even if URL isn't in database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockCloak no

# Allow heuristic match to take precedence.
# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU
# scan-time.
# When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at
# the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported
#
# Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses 
# differently from "real" malware.
# If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, 
# the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
#
# Default: no
#HeuristicScanPrecedence yes

##
## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
##

# Enable the DLP module
# Default: No
#StructuredDataDetection yes

# This option sets the lowest number of Credit Card numbers found in a file
# to generate a detect.
# Default: 3
#StructuredMinCreditCardCount 5

# This option sets the lowest number of Social Security Numbers found
# in a file to generate a detect.

##
## Archives
##

# ClamAV can scan within archives and compressed files.

# without unpacking and additional processing.
# Default: yes
ScanArchive yes

# Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
# Default: no
ArchiveBlockEncrypted no


##
## Limits
##

# The options below protect your system against Denial of Service attacks
# using archive bombs.

# This option sets the maximum amount of data to be scanned for each input file.
# Archives and other containers are recursively extracted and scanned up to this
# value.
# Value of 0 disables the limit
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
# Default: 100M
#MaxScanSize 150M

# Files larger than this limit won't be scanned. Affects the input file itself
# as well as files contained inside it (when the input file is an archive, a
# document or some other kind of container).
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
# Default: 25M
#MaxFileSize 30M

# Nested archives are scanned recursively, e.g. if a Zip archive contains a RAR
# file, all files within it will also be scanned. This options specifies how
# deeply the process should be continued.
# Note: setting this limit too high may result in severe damage to the system.
# Default: 16
#MaxRecursion 10

# Number of files to be scanned within an archive, a document, or any other
# container file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Note: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage
# to the system.
# Default: 10000
#MaxFiles 15000


##
## Clamuko settings
##

# Enable Clamuko. Dazuko must be configured and running. Clamuko supports
# both Dazuko (/dev/dazuko) and DazukoFS (/dev/dazukofs.ctrl). DazukoFS
# is the preferred option. For more information please visit www.dazuko.org
# Default: no
#ClamukoScanOnAccess yes

# The number of scanner threads that will be started (DazukoFS only).
# Having multiple scanner threads allows Clamuko to serve multiple
# processes simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial on SMP machines.
# Default: 3
#ClamukoScannerCount 3

# Don't scan files larger than ClamukoMaxFileSize
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 5M
#ClamukoMaxFileSize 10M

# Set access mask for Clamuko (Dazuko only).
# Default: no
#ClamukoScanOnOpen yes
#ClamukoScanOnClose yes
#ClamukoScanOnExec yes

# Set the include paths (all files inside them will be scanned). You can have
# multiple ClamukoIncludePath directives but each directory must be added
# in a seperate line. (Dazuko only)
# Default: disabled
#ClamukoIncludePath /home
#ClamukoIncludePath /students

# Set the exclude paths. All subdirectories are also excluded. (Dazuko only)
# Default: disabled
#ClamukoExcludePath /home/bofh

# With this option you can whitelist specific UIDs. Processes with these UIDs
# will be able to access all files.
# This option can be used multiple times (one per line).
# Default: disabled
#ClamukoExcludeUID 0

# With this option enabled ClamAV will load bytecode from the database. 
# It is highly recommended you keep this option on, otherwise you'll miss detections for many new viruses.
# Default: yes
#Bytecode yes

# Set bytecode security level.
# Possible values:
#       None - no security at all, meant for debugging. DO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
#         This value is only available if clamav was built with --enable-debug!
#       TrustSigned - trust bytecode loaded from signed .c[lv]d files,
#                insert runtime safety checks for bytecode loaded from other sources
#       Paranoid - don't trust any bytecode, insert runtime checks for all
# Recommended: TrustSigned, because bytecode in .cvd files already has these checks
# Note that by default only signed bytecode is loaded, currently you can only
# load unsigned bytecode in --enable-debug mode.
#
# Default: TrustSigned
#BytecodeSecurity TrustSigned

# Set bytecode timeout in miliseconds.
# 
# Default: 5000
# BytecodeTimeout 1000
